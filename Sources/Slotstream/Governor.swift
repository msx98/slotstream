// Elastic pool governor: resizes the expert cache while the server runs.
//
// The pool is a cache, and the machine's memory state changes over a daemon's
// lifetime — a startup-time size can't be right forever. The governor listens
// to macOS memory-pressure events (the OS pushes warning/critical — a better
// signal than any polling) plus a slow availability poll, and resizes the pool
// strictly between requests under the engine's generation lock.
//
// Policy: shrink fast, grow slow. Two complementary signals:
//   - availability (poll, 15 s): the feasibility replan — "what would a fresh
//     auto start pick right now", crediting everything a restart would release
//     (pool + fixed footprint). Converges in ONE step; dead-bands are absolute
//     GB (shrink at −1 GB, grow at +2 GB) because a relative trigger can never
//     fire when the honest adjustment is a few GB on a large pool. Handles
//     apps opening/closing gently. Note availability alone cannot see
//     overcommit that macOS already absorbed into compressor/swap.
//   - OS pressure events (warning/critical): the OS's own compressor/swap
//     view. Shed an absolute chunk immediately (warning: ≥2 GB / 15%,
//     critical: ≥4 GB / 50%); repeated events keep shedding. Growth waits for
//     60 s of calm after any event.
//   - elastic applies to auto-sized pools only: an explicit knob is the user's
//     stated intent and is never resized (same principle as the startup clamp).
//
// Correctness is untouched by construction: the golden-equivalence gate proves
// output is byte-identical at any pool size, and `slotstream elastic-check`
// re-proves it across live grow/shrink in one process.
