# slotstream

[![release](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream/actions/workflows/release.yml) [![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/carloslfu/slotstream?label=latest%20release)](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream/releases/latest)

Run **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next** on a Mac that can't hold it. The model is a
125B-parameter mixture-of-experts, 104 GB on disk at 4-bit; slotstream streams
it from SSD and runs it in whatever memory you give it. It's one Swift binary,
no Python. It speaks the Ollama and OpenAI chat APIs, so your existing tools
work unchanged.

| on a 48 GB M5 Pro | |
|---|---|
| Warm decode | ~12 tok/s |
| Engine start | ~2 s (only the 3.8 GB trunk loads) |
| Peak memory | 32 GB (auto-sized; you can cap it) |
| Weights on disk | 104 GB |

## Will it run on my Mac?

You need Apple Silicon, macOS 14+, and ~110 GB of free disk. Disk bites
first: whatever your memory, a 512 GB Mac is the realistic minimum.

Auto-sizing never takes the whole machine. What each tier gets:

| your Mac | slotstream takes | warm decode |
|---|---|---|
| 8 GB | 8.1 GB, the floor | ~3 tok/s, and `doctor` warns it will page |
| 16 GB | 10 GB | ~4 tok/s |
| 24 GB | 16 GB | ~8 tok/s |
| 32 GB | 22 GB | ~9 tok/s |
| 48 GB and up | 33 GB (more buys nothing; see [Memory](#memory)) | ~12 tok/s |

These rows come straight from `slotstream doctor --sim-ram N`, so you can
reproduce them. Only the 48 GB row is measured on real hardware; the others
are estimates from its curve, and smaller Macs also have slower SSDs. Run
`slotstream doctor` before downloading anything: it prints your machine's
plan and whether the disk can hold the weights.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carloslfu/slotstream/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the latest release to `~/.slotstream/bin` and puts it on your PATH.
Re-run the same line to upgrade. To uninstall, `rm -rf ~/.slotstream` and
remove the `/usr/local/bin/slotstream` wrapper or the PATH line the installer
told you it added.

Releases are built by CI from the tagged commit with signed provenance, so you
can verify an asset instead of trusting the download:

```bash
gh attestation verify slotstream-arm64.tar.gz --repo carloslfu/slotstream
```

Or build `main` yourself. Command Line Tools are enough, no Xcode needed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream && cd slotstream
make build
```

### The 104 GB download

The binary is small; the weights are not: 103.8 GB across 24 files, one time.
`serve` and `run` offer the download on first use, or `slotstream pull` does
it directly. Before transferring anything it prints the size, the destination,
and your free disk, waits for a yes, and refuses outright if the disk can't
hold it.

A real install took 35 minutes. Hugging Face caps the transfer at roughly
36–57 MB/s however many connections you open, so past ~400 Mbps the wait is
Hugging Face's day, not your link. At 100 Mbps plan on ~2 h 20; at 25 Mbps,
~9 h.

Interrupting is safe: `pull` resumes exactly where it left off, and all
24 files are checked against sha256 hashes compiled into the binary, so a
truncated or corrupted download can't reach the engine. `pull --verify`
re-hashes an existing copy any time (8 s here).

## Use it

First taste, no server:

```bash
slotstream run --prompt "why is the sky blue?"
```

For everything else, `serve` listens on port 11434 and implements the
chat/generate subset used by Ollama clients and OpenAI SDKs:

```bash
slotstream serve
```

```bash
curl localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{
  "model": "qwen3.8-flash-next:4bit",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]
}'
```

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434 ollama run qwen3.8-flash-next:4bit
```

Open WebUI, the Ollama CLI, and the OpenAI SDKs are tested against this
subset. Streaming, CORS, and the usual sampling options all work. Tool calling
and vision (`image_url`) are supported on `/v1/chat/completions` (Qwen
`<tool_call>` XML ↔ OpenAI `tool_calls`, streamed incrementally). What isn't
supported (JSON-schema output, logprobs) returns a clear 400 instead of being
silently ignored. Every endpoint, field, default, and error is in
[docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## Speed

Decode is the easy part: ~12 tok/s warm on a 48 GB Mac, and the tier table
above says what smaller ones get. The slow axis is the prompt. All of it is
processed before the first token appears, so 8,000 tokens wait about a minute
on a 48 GB Mac and over three on a 16 GB one. Prompt plus completion is
capped at 32,768 tokens (`--max-context`).

Within a conversation you only pay that once. Follow-up turns prefill just
what's new, so time to first token stays flat as the chat grows: over eight
turns at a 16 GB target, 6.0 s on the last turn instead of 25.8 s. Reused
state isn't bit-identical to recomputing it, so a reply can occasionally
differ where two tokens were nearly tied; `--no-prefix-cache` turns it off if
you need exact reproducibility.

## Memory

With no flags, slotstream sizes itself to your machine and tells you what it
chose. This is a 48 GB Mac; it reads 52 because everything here counts in
decimal GB:

```
slotstream memory plan (auto)
  device: 52 GB RAM (36.0 GB reclaimable now), 40.2 GB Metal working set
  target: 33.0 GB total for this process   (override: --memory-gb N | --max-ram-percent P)
  cache:  ~152 of 512 experts per layer  (7280 global slots = 20.1 GB pool)
  expect: ~32.0 GB peak, ~12 tok/s warm decode (est. from M5 Pro anchors)
  prefill: 4096 tokens per pass (~125 tok/s here; costs ~5.3 GB of the target)
  reuse:  up to 32768 tokens across 4 conversations (~1.2 GB), so a follow-up turn re-prefills only what is new
```

Auto takes the lowest of three limits (33 GB, 70% of RAM, and 2 GB under the
Metal working-set limit) and sizes down further while other apps are actually
holding memory. The 33 GB cap is the knee of the measured curve, not
politeness: in a GB-at-a-time sweep, nothing between 34 and 84 GB decoded or
prefilled any faster, so a 128 GB Mac gets the same plan a 48 GB one does.
While running, slotstream re-checks every 15 s and resizes the cache between
requests, shrinking under pressure and growing back once the pressure passes.
Output is byte-identical across resizes.

To cap it yourself, `--memory-gb G` sets the total for the process (minimum
8.1, and it will go past 33 if you want to experiment). `--max-ram-percent P`
moves the 70% share, and `--experts-per-layer` / `--pool-gb` size the cache
directly. `slotstream doctor` prints the plan any of these would produce
without loading anything.

## How it works

Almost all of the model's bytes sit in two places: 68 GB of routed experts
(512 per layer, 10 active per token) and a 32 GB n-gram table. The dense trunk
is only 3.8 GB and stays resident. Experts are read with `pread` into a fixed
pool of cache slots shared by all 48 layers, so hot layers borrow slots from
cold ones.

**Cache size changes speed, never output.** Greedy decoding is byte-identical
between a 4 GB cache and a 24 GB one, and that equivalence is a standing test.

Why not just mmap the file? MLX (Apple's ML framework) can't materialize part
of a memory-mapped tensor: a top-10 expert gather evaluates all 512 experts of
that layer, so an mmap path loads ~100 GB and dies. The stock `mlx_lm.load()`
route took this 48 GB machine into 48 GB of swap without producing a token.

## Status and limits

Working, and measured on one machine, an M5 Pro with 48 GB. The smaller tiers
are estimates from its curve, not runs on real hardware.

- **One model, one process.** v0 runs exactly `qwen3.8-flash-next:4bit`; the
  engine is built around its geometry, and `pull` knows no other name. A
  per-user lock allows one model process at a time.
- **macOS 14 and 15** have only had the installer exercised, not the runtime.

## In progress

On `main` but not in a release yet. `curl | sh` installs the latest release,
so none of this is on your machine unless you build from source.
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) keeps the running list.

- **Speculative decode (`--mtp`).** The model ships a draft head that
  predicts the token after next; slotstream drafts a few tokens ahead and
  verifies them in one batched pass, and the first draft is right 86% of the
  time (measured). It only pays where the expert cache is already near its
  best: at small caches the A/B says ×0.96, so auto keeps it off below
  ~26 GB of target, and the ×1.5–1.9 expected above that is arithmetic from
  the accept rate, not yet an A/B. The head costs 1.6 GB on top of the cache,
  so the auto ceiling becomes 34.6 GB. It needs a one-time conversion that
  pulls ~6.3 GB from the official release and writes a 1.5 GB
  `mtp.safetensors` next to the weights (`Tools/mtp_convert.py`, run from a
  clone with the repo's Python environment); without the file, everything
  runs with it off.

## Testing

`Tools/verify.sh` is the acceptance battery: weight provenance, goldens
against a version-matched Python reference, byte-equality across cache sizes
and live resizes, and a serving-robustness suite of inputs that used to crash
the server. `Tools/e2e_release.sh` tests the other thing users actually
touch: the `curl | sh` install and the binary it leaves behind. The parts
that need no weights run in CI on every release build.
