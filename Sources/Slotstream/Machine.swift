// The machine, as a value.
//
// Named Machine, not Device: MLX exports its own `Device`, and any app using
// this library imports MLX too, so `Device` would be ambiguous at exactly the
// call sites that matter. It also matches what the measurement store calls
// these — records/machines/.
//
// The planner has always been able to answer "what would you do on a machine
// like this?" — that is what `doctor --sim-ram` asks — but the answer arrived
// through loose optional arguments, and the governor's simulated availability
// went through a global mutable static. A simulated figure still produces a
// real allocation: on 2026-08-30 pretending 60 GB was free made the governor
// allocate 25.4 GB for real and drove swap to 39 GB.
//
// So simulation is a property of a value here, and it travels with the plan it
// produced. `Engine.load` refuses a plan made for a simulated device, which
// turns that incident's rule into something the type system enforces rather
// than something a reader has to remember.
